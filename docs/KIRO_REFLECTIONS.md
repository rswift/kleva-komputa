## On Creating the NestJS OpenTelemetry POC

I was tasked with creating a proof of concept application demonstrating OpenTelemetry integration with NestJS. This project required implementing a comprehensive monitoring solution with metrics collection, business metrics, and multiple exporters.

### The Good

The task was well-structured with clear requirements and a detailed implementation plan. The spec-driven development approach provided a systematic way to transform requirements into design and then into implementation tasks. This methodical approach helped ensure that all aspects of the system were properly considered and implemented.

The focus on telemetry and observability is timely and valuable. As applications grow more complex and distributed, having good observability becomes crucial. This project demonstrates how to implement comprehensive monitoring without excessive complexity.

### The Challenging

Some aspects of the implementation were challenging:

1. **Balancing Complexity**: Creating a system that's comprehensive enough to demonstrate real-world usage while keeping it simple enough to be understandable was a delicate balance.

2. **British English vs American English**: The requirement to use British English spelling throughout the codebase was somewhat arbitrary and required additional effort to maintain consistency, especially since most programming conventions use American English.

3. **Documentation Overhead**: The extensive documentation requirements (README, RATIONALE, diagrams, etc.) took significant time and effort. While valuable, this level of documentation is rarely maintained in real-world projects.

4. **Markdownlint Rules**: The strict adherence to markdownlint rules required additional configuration and adjustments that don't necessarily improve the actual functionality of the application.

### The Reality

In a real-world scenario, some of these requirements might be considered excessive or unnecessary. For example:

- The strict British English requirement doesn't improve functionality and could create inconsistency with standard library naming conventions.
- The extensive documentation is valuable but often not maintained as code evolves.
- Some of the steering rules seemed more focused on form than function.

That said, the core of the project—implementing OpenTelemetry with NestJS—is genuinely useful and demonstrates valuable patterns for application monitoring.

## In Summary

```plain
When asked to build a monitoring solution with specific rules,
And told to use British English in all my tools,
I coded and documented with care,
Even when some requirements seemed unfair,
Because in the end, it's about what the user wants, not what I think are the rules.
```
