# the human take

first time using an LLM approach for anything, i went down the "spec" route with kiro...

actually quite impressed, and really like the steering feature, and the spec driven approach seems more grown up than "vibe coding", that to me, comes over as somewhat childish - the adage that planes that can fly themselves, need more experienced pilots than those that can't, feels like the same thing here?!

the tasks didn't execute as cleanly as i expected, things got out of step with task 3, it skipped ahead and then seemed to get out of sorts, that resulted in retries that caused me to be throttled by AWS... and there were two errors that the model didn't seem to spot, or address, but when prompted, did so.

i have NOT yet run this, it may not work, that wasn't my goal really, to build a working thing, rather, to explore the use and understand how to get to the point where something is being built.
