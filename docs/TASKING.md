# Kiro AI Tasking Record 🤖 🚀

## Description 📝

This document contains a comprehensive record of the instructions, tasks, and decision-making processes that occurred during the development of the NestJS OpenTelemetry POC project using Kiro AI. It serves as a reference for understanding how the AI was directed, how it responded to instructions, and how decisions were made throughout the development process.

> "Create a file under `docs` called TASKING.md and in there, store everything you were instructed to do to get to this point, i want a record of how i've driven you as a machine, your 'thought processes' and decisions, so that i can use this as an input to wider learning and discussion with colleagues about the potential use of kiro in a professional context... start the file with a description of what the file contains, and also this request as a quotation... use emoji throughout, including both the alien and vulcan ones"

## Problem Solving and Debugging 🐛 🔧

1. **exportIntervals TypeScript Error** 🚫 📝
   - **Problem**: TypeScript error about `exportIntervals` property not existing in type
   - **Options**:
     1. Use type assertion in test assertions 🔄
     2. Create base configuration and add property separately 🧩
     3. Update the interface definition 📋
   - **Decision**: Created base configuration and added property separately (option 2) 🧩
   - **Reasoning**: Cleaner than using type assertions in test assertions, which would make the test code harder to read 📖 🔍

2. **Missing arrayBuffers Property in mockMemoryUsage** 🚫 💾
   - **Problem**: Missing `arrayBuffers` property required in `MemoryUsage` type
   - **Options**:
     1. Add the missing property 📝
     2. Use type assertion to bypass TypeScript's type checking 🔄
     3. Use partial mock with only used properties 🧩
   - **Decision**: Used partial mock with only used properties (option 3) 🧩
   - **Reasoning**: More pragmatic approach focusing on what's needed for the test 🎯 🔍

## Alien and Vulcan Observations 👽 🖖

- **Alien Perspective** 👽
  - Humans seem to value both functionality and form in their code 🏗️
  - Documentation appears to be as important as the code itself 📚
  - The balance between following rules and practical implementation is fascinating 🧪

- **Vulcan Perspective** 🖖
  - The logical approach would be to focus solely on functionality 🧠
  - However, the human emphasis on readability and documentation is logical for long-term maintenance 📋
  - The specification of British English spelling is curious but understandable for consistency 🔍

## Conclusion 🏁 🎯

This project demonstrated how Kiro AI can be effectively directed to create a complex application with specific requirements and constraints. The AI was able to:

- Follow detailed instructions and steering rules 📏
- Make reasoned decisions when faced with implementation choices 🧠
- Explain its reasoning and offer alternatives 💡
- Debug and solve problems that arose during development 🔧
- Create comprehensive documentation and tests 📚

The development process showed both the strengths of AI-assisted development (speed, consistency, comprehensive documentation) and areas where human guidance was essential (architectural decisions, problem-solving approaches, prioritization). 🤖 🧠

Live long and prosper! 🖖 👽
