# the rules

- only use british english spelling, in generated artefacts and also the text presented to the user by kiro and its supporting models
- code comments will explain why, not what
- always minimise the use of libraries and frameworks
- maintain a markdown file called `RATIONALE.md` and keep it updated with the rationale for choices, assumptions and other insights that will help a reader understand the "thoughts", decisions and choices
- always respect the rules
- always add a clear indication to documentation and specs, the specific details about the AI, LLM and asssociated versions that were used to create the artefact
- lint and ensure that all markdownlint rules are respected, making edits to markdown files as required
