# tooling

- evaluate the project and confirm what tools and utilities are required in macOS to run the project
- never install anything without permission

## markdown

- create and maintain the markdownlint settings:
  - for MD024 in `no-duplicate-heading`, set `siblings_only` to `true`

## mermaid

- always ensure mermaid diagrams render correctly, if necessary, prompt the user to confirm
- minimise the use of styling unless it is absolutely necessary for clarity or readability
