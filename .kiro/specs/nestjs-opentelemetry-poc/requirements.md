## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a proof of concept (POC) application that demonstrates how OpenTelemetry counters and metrics can be used to instrument a simple API built with NestJS. The focus of this POC is on the telemetry implementation rather than the API functionality itself. The POC will include comprehensive documentation, architecture diagrams, and sequence diagrams to help developers understand the implementation, choices, and trade-offs made during development.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to implement OpenTelemetry instrumentation in a NestJS application, so that I can monitor application performance and behaviour through metrics and counters.

#### Acceptance Criteria 1

1. WHEN the NestJS application starts THEN the system SHALL initialise OpenTelemetry with appropriate configuration.
2. WHEN the application receives HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL automatically capture request metrics including count, duration, and status codes.
3. WHEN application code executes THEN the system SHALL provide a way to create and update custom counters and metrics.
4. WHEN metrics are collected THEN the system SHALL export them to a configurable endpoint or service.
5. WHEN the application is running THEN the system SHALL expose an endpoint to view current metrics.

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a simple API implementation to demonstrate the OpenTelemetry instrumentation, so that I can see how telemetry works in a realistic context.

#### Acceptance Criteria 2

1. WHEN designing the API THEN the system SHALL include at least three distinct endpoints with different functionality.
2. WHEN implementing the API THEN the system SHALL demonstrate different types of operations (e.g., data retrieval, data manipulation, error scenarios).
3. WHEN the API is implemented THEN the system SHALL follow NestJS best practices for structure and organisation.
4. WHEN the API is running THEN the system SHALL demonstrate realistic latency and behaviour patterns.

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive configuration options for OpenTelemetry, so that I can adapt the telemetry to different environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria 3

1. WHEN configuring OpenTelemetry THEN the system SHALL support environment-based configuration.
2. WHEN setting up the application THEN the system SHALL provide configuration options for different exporters (e.g., console, Prometheus, Jaeger).
3. WHEN configuring metrics THEN the system SHALL allow customisation of metric names, labels, and descriptions.
4. WHEN running the application THEN the system SHALL validate and provide feedback on telemetry configuration.

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive documentation and diagrams, so that I can understand how the OpenTelemetry implementation works and how to use it.

#### Acceptance Criteria 4

1. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a README.md with clear setup and usage instructions.
2. WHEN examining the architecture THEN the system SHALL include an architecture diagram showing the components and their interactions.
3. WHEN understanding the flow THEN the system SHALL include sequence diagrams for key operations.
4. WHEN reading the code THEN the system SHALL include comments explaining the rationale behind implementation choices.
5. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN the system SHALL maintain a RATIONALE.md file explaining design decisions and trade-offs.
6. WHEN examining the documentation THEN the system SHALL use British English spelling throughout.

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed incremental counters and timing metrics for API calls, so that I can monitor API usage patterns and performance characteristics with contextual information.

#### Acceptance Criteria 5

1. WHEN an API endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL increment a counter specific to that endpoint.
2. WHEN an API call completes THEN the system SHALL record the atomic time taken to service the request.
3. WHEN recording API metrics THEN the system SHALL include additional attributes such as API parameters and contextual information.
4. WHEN storing timing metrics THEN the system SHALL preserve the relationship between the timing and the specific API call instance.
5. WHEN viewing metrics THEN the system SHALL provide a way to analyse both aggregate statistics and individual call performance.

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to minimise the use of external libraries beyond NestJS and OpenTelemetry, so that the implementation remains focused and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria 6

1. WHEN implementing the application THEN the system SHALL only include essential dependencies.
2. WHEN choosing libraries THEN the system SHALL justify each additional library in the RATIONALE.md file.
3. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL prefer native solutions over additional dependencies when reasonable.
